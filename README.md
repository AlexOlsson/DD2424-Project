# README

We started our implementation based on https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html, however over the course of the project that template was heavily modified and many parts of the template were rewritten or removed and new parts added.

The included notebooks might not be in exactly the state they were in when the reported experiments were run, but they should be reasonably close.
