We began our implementation based on the tutorial found at https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html. However, over the course of the project, we heavily modified the template, rewriting or removing many parts and adding many new ones.

The included notebooks may not be in the exact state they were in when the reported experiments were conducted, but they should be reasonably similar.
